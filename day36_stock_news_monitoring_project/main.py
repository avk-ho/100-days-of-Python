# Stock news monitoring project

import requests

STOCK = "TSLA"

## STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").

# Creating the request
stock_url = "https://www.alphavantage.co/query?"
stock_params = {
    "function": "TIME_SERIES_DAILY",
    "symbol": STOCK,
    "apikey": STOCK_API_KEY
}

# Getting the 2 previous stock prices at closing

# Comparing the 2 last stock prices

# if get_news:
#     print("Get news")

## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME. 
get_news = True

    # Creating the request
    news_url = "https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?"

    news_requests.raise_for_status()
    news_data = news_requests.json()

    # Getting the articles
    news_articles = news_data["articles"]

## STEP 3: Use https://www.twilio.com
# Send a seperate message with the percentage change and each article's title and description to your phone number. 

    # Formatting the article
    def formatNewsArticles(news_articles_list):
        message = ""
        for article in news_articles_list:
            headline = article['title']
            description = article["description"]
            message += f"Headline: {headline}\nBrief: {description}\n"
            # regex to clear html tags
            message = re.sub('<[^<]+?>', '', message)
        return message

    news_message = formatNewsArticles(news_articles)

    # Formatting the final sms message
    if percent_difference < 0:
        percent_difference_str = f"ðŸ”»{abs(round(percent_difference, 3))}%"
    else:

    sms_message = f'{STOCK}: {percent_difference_str}\n{news_message}'
    print(sms_message)


#Optional: Format the SMS message like this:
