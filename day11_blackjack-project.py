############### Our Blackjack House Rules #####################

## The deck is unlimited in size.
## There are no jokers.
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.

# Solo attempt

# If the player score is above 21, they lose ("bust")
# If the score of the dealer is < 17, they must take another card
# If at the end, the player and dealer have the same score, it's a draw
# Ace is counted as 11 below 21, or 1 if the count ends up above 21

# The player is given 2 cards
# The dealer has one card visible, another hidden to the player
# The player can ask to be given another card, or can stand (stop with their current score)
# The dealer reveal their second card, if score < 17, they must take another card, hidden unless the player did stand
# Repeat 2 previous phases
# The game is ended if the dealer gets 21
